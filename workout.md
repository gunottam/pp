# DETAILED SYNCHRONIZED WORKOUTS

## **MONDAY - LOWER BODY + GLUTES (Together, 65 minutes)**

**HER PRIMARY DAY** - Maximum glute focus
**Your Secondary Day** - Glute + Leg volume

### Warm-Up (10 minutes)
- 5 min light cycling/treadmill
- Glute activation: 
  - Clamshells: 2 x 15 each side
  - Fire hydrants: 2 x 15 each side
  - Glute bridges: 2 x 20

---

### **EXERCISE 1: HIP THRUSTS (You do TOGETHER)**
**Sets x Reps**: 
- YOU: 4 x 8-10 (heavy weight, focus on strength)
- HER: 4 x 10-12 (moderate-heavy weight)

| Setup | Execution |
|-------|-----------|
| Sit back-to-back against bench | Both load barbells (your weight heavier) |
| Plant feet shoulder-width apart | Thrust hips up, squeeze glutes hard at top |
| Drive through heels | 2-sec hold, lower controlled |

**Rest Between Sets**: 90 seconds
**Key Cue**: For both: "Squeeze glutes HARD at the top, not lower back"

---

### **EXERCISE 2: ROMANIAN DEADLIFTS (Together, Different Weights)**
**Sets x Reps**: 
- YOU: 3 x 8-10 (Heavy - focus on strength + hamstring development)
- HER: 3 x 10-12 (Moderate - learn form, hamstring + glute development)

**Technique**:
1. Stand with feet hip-width apart
2. Slight knee bend throughout (DON'T SQUAT)
3. Hinge at hips, feel hamstring stretch
4. Lower bar until chest nearly parallel to floor
5. Drive hips forward to stand

**Common Mistakes**:
- â Rounding lower back (causes injury)
- â Going too deep if tight hamstrings
- â Keep back straight, hinge from hips

**Rest**: 90 seconds between sets

---

### **EXERCISE 3: BULGARIAN SPLIT SQUATS (Together, Unilateral)**

**Setup**:
- Front foot 2 feet from bench
- Back foot elevated on bench at shin height
- You go, I go format: You complete all reps one leg, then switch. She does same while you rest.

**Form**:
1. Lower down, front knee bends to 90Â°
2. Back knee almost touches floor
3. Drive through front heel to stand
4. Keeps pressure on FRONT LEG (the glute/quad working)

- You go, I go: Alternate sets

**Rest**: 45 seconds

**Why**: Isolates hamstrings, allows recovery while partner goes

---

### **EXERCISE 5: CABLE GLUTE KICKBACKS (Unilateral Activation)**
**Sets x Reps**:

**Movement**:
1. Keep working leg slightly bent

## **TOTAL VOLUME PER WEEK**

**For You**: 
- Monday: Lower + Glutes
- Wednesday: Upper Body
- Thursday: Cardio
- Friday: Lower Body
- Saturday: Full Body
- Total: 5 training days (6 if you count cardio)

**For Her**:

- Wednesday: Upper Body
- Friday: Lower Body
- Saturday: Lower + Glutes (high volume)
- Total: 4-5 training days
- Glute Focus: 3x per week (Mon, Fri, Sat) = MAXIMUM GROWTH

---

## **KEY PRINCIPLES**

### **1. She Trains Together with You on Your Schedule**
- No more separate days
- Shared gym time increases adherence by 40%
- You motivate each other

### **2. Weight Variations**
- You use heavier weight on most exercises
- She uses appropriate beginner weight
- Same exercise, different intensity = both benefit

### **3. Glute Specialization for Her**
- 3x per week dedicated glute volume (Mon, Fri, Sat)
- Each day targets glutes differently
- Research shows glutes need high frequency for growth

### **4. Breast Preservation**
- Light chest work only (maintains pectoral muscle)
- Doesn't reduce breast size
- Maintains structural support

### **5. You-Go-I-Go Format**
- You complete your set while she rests
- She completes her set while you rest
- Maximizes gym time together
- No waiting around

### **6. Progressive Overload**
- Track every workout
- Week 1-4: Learn form
- Week 5-12: Add weight every 1-2 weeks
- Her glutes: Add weight to hip thrusts progressively

---

## **12-WEEK PROGRESSION**

### **WEEKS 1-2: Learning Phase**
- Focus on FORM over weight
- You: Use 70% of your max weights
- Her: Use very light weights, learn movement patterns
- Goal: Perfect technique

### **WEEKS 3-4: Building Phase**
- Increase weights slightly
- You: 80-85% of max weights
- Her: Add 2.5-5kg to major lifts
- Goal: Build work capacity

### **WEEKS 5-8: Progression Phase**
- Progressive overload begins
- You: Add 2.5-5kg every week to major lifts
- Her: Add 2.5kg every 7-10 days
- Goal: Steady strength + muscle growth

### **WEEKS 9-12: Peak Phase**
- Maintain heavy weights
- Focus on perfect form
- You: Small increases (1-2.5kg)
- Her: Continue 2.5kg increases
- Goal: Final muscle gains + fat loss

---

## **EXPECTED RESULTS (12 Weeks)**

### **For You**:
- Fat loss: 8-12kg
- Body fat: 32% â 22-24%
- Muscle gain: Maintain or slight gain
- Strength increase: 20-30% on major lifts
- Visible: Lean, muscular aesthetic

### **For Her**:
- Muscle gain: 3-5kg (mostly glutes)
- Glute growth: 3-6cm circumference increase
- Waist: May appear smaller (ab development) = hourglass ratio improves
- Strength increase: 50-100% (beginner gains)
- Visible: Rounder glutes, wider hips, shoulder width, maintained chest

---

## **IMPORTANT RULES**

1. â **ALWAYS track your workouts** - write down weights, reps, sets
2. â **EAT ENOUGH PROTEIN** - 180-200g for you, 1.6-2.0g/kg for her
3. â **SLEEP 7-9 HOURS** - muscle grows during sleep
4. â **STAY HYDRATED** - 3-4L water daily
5. â **PERFECT FORM FIRST** - ego lifting ruins progress
6. â **REST BETWEEN SETS** - don't rush
7. â **COMMUNICATE** - help each other with form
8. â **CONSISTENCY** - missing 1 workout = no big deal, missing weeks = big problem
9. â **HAVE FUN** - couple fitness is bonding experience
10. â **TRUST THE PROCESS** - results come after 6-8 weeks

---

## **COMMON QUESTIONS**

**Q: Can she really build glutes 3x per week?**
A: YES! Research shows glutes respond well to high frequency (2-4x/week). Mon/Fri/Sat = optimal for growth while allowing recovery.

**Q: Will light chest work preserve her breast size?**
A: YES! Light resistance maintains pectoral muscle which supports breast tissue. Heavy chest work = muscle gain = appearance of smaller breasts. Light work = maintenance.

**Q: What if we miss a day?**
A: Don't panic. Skip the missed day and continue with next scheduled day. Make up is optional. Missing one workout = minimal damage.

**Q: Should she do cardio?**
A: Optional. She can do light walk on Thursday if she wants. Too much cardio interferes with muscle growth. Limit to 1-2x/week.

**Q: When will she see glute growth?**
A: Visible changes in 4-6 weeks. Maximum changes by week 10-12. Measurement increase happens before visual changes.

**Q: Can we modify exercises?**
A: YES! If equipment is unavailable, substitute with similar movement (e.g., leg press instead of squat). Message: email or DM for alternatives.
