## 🔥 THE CARDIO (The Fat Incinerator)
*We do not "jog". We either walk to burn fat or run to build lungs.*

### 1. The Daily "Non-Negotiable" (Every Single Day)
* **Activity:** Walking.
* **Target:** 10,000 Steps minimum.
* **Why:** This burns pure fat without making you hungry.
* **When:** Walk to class, pace while thinking about code, walk while on calls.

### 2. The "Zone 2" Outdoor Run (Wednesday & Sunday Only)
* **Activity:** Slow, steady outdoor running.
* **Vibe:** You should be able to hold a conversation, but just barely.
* **Speed:** Slow. Like 7-8 km/hr. Don't sprint.
* **Duration:** 30-40 Minutes.
* **Audio:** Listen to a podcast or lo-fi beats. No hype music. Keep heart rate steady.

## ⚠️ RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

1.  **NO EGO LIFTING:** Control the weight. If you swing it, you didn't lift it.
2.  **THE PROTEIN RULE:** If you miss a meal, you drink a shake. Never miss protein.
3.  **THE SLEEP LAW:** If you are awake at 22:00, you are failing the mission.
4.  **CONSISTENCY > INTENSITY:** A bad workout is better than no workout.

**EXECUTE.** 👊
